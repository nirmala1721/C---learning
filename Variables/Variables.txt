1. A variable is a name given to a memory location where data can be stored. Its value can be changed during program execution.
2. Variables must be declared before use in C++.

Rules for creating variables in C++:
a. Variable names can consist of alphabets, digits, and underscores.
b. Variable names must begin with an alphabet or an underscore.
c. Variable names must not start with digits or any special characters.
d. Reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names.
e. Variable names are case-sensitive.

The syntax for declaring a variable is: variable_type variable_name;

Variables can be declared in several ways, for example:
I.   int age;        // Declaration without initialization
II.  int age(2);     // Constructor initialization
III. int age{2};     // C++11 list initialization
IV.  int age = 2;    // C-like initialization

3. There are three types of variables:
   1. Local Variable
   2. Instance Variable
   3. Static Variable

 1. Local Variable
   a. Declared inside a block of code or a function.
   b. Exists only while the function or block is running.
   c. Cannot be used outside the function or block where it is declared.
   d. Memory is allocated when the function is called.
   e. Memory is released when the function ends.
   f. Must be declared and often initialized before use.

 2. Instance Variable
   a. Declared inside a class but outside any function.
   b. Belongs to each object (instance) of the class.
   c. Each object gets its own copy of the instance variable.

 3. Static Variable
   a. Retains its value even after the function ends.
   b. Is not re-created every time the function or object runs.
   c. Is sharedâ€”only one copy exists in memory.
