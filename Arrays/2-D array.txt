1. A 2-D array (two-dimensional array) is a type of array that stores data in a tabular form, i.e., in rows and columnsâ€”just like a matrix.
2. A 2-D array is essentially an array of arrays.
3. If you imagine a 1-D array as a row:
   i. This is 1-d normal array 
         [10, 20, 30]

   ii. A 2-D array will look like:
           [ [10, 20, 30],
             [40, 50, 60],
             [70, 80, 90] ]
           This is a 3x3 (3 rows, 3 columns) 2-D array.
