1. In C++, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. C++ supports a wide range of operators.

2. Types of Operators in C++:

a. Arithmetic Operators  
    Used for basic mathematical operations.  
    +   Addition:            a + b  
    -   Subtraction:         a - b  
    *   Multiplication:      a * b  
    /   Division:            a / b  
    %   Modulo (remainder):  a % b  

b. Relational (Comparison) Operators  
    Used to compare two values.  
    ==  Equal to:                  a == b  
    !=  Not equal to:              a != b  
    >   Greater than:              a > b  
    <   Less than:                 a < b  
    >=  Greater than or equal to:  a >= b  
    <=  Less than or equal to:     a <= b  

c. Logical Operators  
    Used for logical operations.  
    &&  Logical AND:   a > 5 && b < 10  
    ||  Logical OR:    a < 5 || b > 10  
    !   Logical NOT:   !(a == b)  

d. Assignment Operators  
    Used to assign values to variables.  
    =   Assign:             a = 10  
    +=  Add and assign:     a += 5   (a = a + 5)  
    -=  Subtract and assign: a -= 3  (a = a - 3)  
    *=  Multiply and assign: a *= 2  (a = a * 2)  
    /=  Divide and assign:   a /= 2  (a = a / 2)  
    %=  Modulo and assign:   a %= 2  (a = a % 2)  

e. Increment and Decrement Operators  
    Used to increase or decrease a value by 1.  
    ++  Increment:   ++a or a++  
    --  Decrement:   --a or a--  

f. Bitwise Operators  
    Operate on individual bits of integer values.  
    &   Bitwise AND:         a & b  
    |   Bitwise OR:          a | b  
    ^   Bitwise XOR:         a ^ b  
    ~   Bitwise NOT:         ~a  
    <<  Left shift:          a << 1  
    >>  Right shift:         a >> 1
