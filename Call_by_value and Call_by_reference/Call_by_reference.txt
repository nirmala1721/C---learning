Call by reference
1. In call by reference instead of passing the copy of variable we pass the actual reference (address) of the variable to the function
2. the function works with orginal variable
3. any changes  made inside the variable effect the outside variable function 
syntax:
void function_name(int &x) {
    // code
}
4. Why the & symbol?
The & here tells the compiler: “Do not create a copy of the variable. Instead, use a reference to the original one.”
