1.IN c++ literals are fixed values directly written in code it represents a constant value used in a program and it is not store in any variable until it is assigned 
2. types of literals are a.integer literal b. string literal c. floating point literal d. charachter literal e.boolean literal f. null point literal 
 a. Integer literal
 Whole numbers without a decimal point.
 int a = 100; // 100 is an integer literal

 b. string literal
 A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes " ".
 string s = "Hello"; // "Hello" is a string literal

 c. Floating point literal
 Numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form.
 float b = 3.14; // 3.14 is a float literal

 d. charachter literal
 A single character enclosed in single quotes ' '.
 char c = 'A'; // 'A' is a character literal

 e. Boolean Literal
 Represent truth values: true or false.
 bool flag = true; // true is a boolean literal

 f.Null Pointer Literal (C++11 and above)
 nullptr is used to represent a null pointer.
 int* ptr = nullptr; // nullptr is a null pointer literal

3. constants: constants are where we cant change the value once it is defined we cannt change it it is a fixed value cannot be changed during execution of a program
4. once declared it will be same value throught the program
5. types of constants are
 a.integer constant b.float constant c. charachter constant d.string constant e. Boolean constant

  a.Integer constant
    Whole numbers without decimal
    const int age = 25;
    age = 30; // ‚ùå Error! Can't change a const value

  b.Float constant
  	Numbers with decimal points
    #define PI 3.14159
    Note: No =, no data type, and this works like a find-replace before compilation.

  c.charachter constant
    A single character enclosed in single quotes examples: 'A', '9', '#'

  d. String Constant
    Sequence of characters inside double quotes example: "Hello", "123"

  e. Boolean Constant
    Logical values representing truth example:true, false
